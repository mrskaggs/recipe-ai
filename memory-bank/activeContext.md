## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Architecture
- **JWT Strategy**: Using access tokens + refresh tokens for security
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds for hashing
- **Session Management**: Token-based with configurable expiration
- **Role System**: Simple admin/user roles with middleware enforcement

### Database Design
- **Normalization**: Proper separation of concerns with related tables
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized for search and filtering operations
- **Constraints**: Foreign keys and check constraints for data integrity
- **Performance**: Query optimization for recipe listing and search

### Frontend State Management
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for auth and recipes
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management for API calls
- **React Hook Form**: Form validation and state handling
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout the application

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Feature-based structure**: Group related components, hooks, and utilities
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between API, UI, and business logic
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage with strict typing
- **Error handling**: Consistent error boundaries and user-friendly messages

### API Design
- **RESTful conventions**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **OpenAPI documentation**: Comprehensive API specs with examples
- **Error responses**: Structured error format with meaningful messages
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication with middleware

### Development Workflow
- **Docker development**: Consistent environment across team members
- **Environment configuration**: Separate configs for dev/staging/production
- **Git practices**: Feature branches with clear commit messages
- **Testing strategy**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for flows

## Current Challenges

### Authentication Flow Complexity
- Managing token refresh and expiration
- Handling authentication state across page reloads
- Coordinating between frontend and backend auth state

### Database Mock Fallback
- Current implementation falls back to mock data when DB unavailable
- Need to ensure smooth transition to production database
- Testing both mock and real database scenarios

### Form Validation
- Complex validation requirements for recipe submission
- Real-time validation feedback for better UX
- Handling both client-side and server-side validation

## Learnings and Insights

### Technical Learnings
- JWT token management requires careful handling of expiration
- PostgreSQL connection pooling is crucial for performance
- Docker networking adds complexity to service communication
- TypeScript interfaces improve code maintainability significantly

### Process Learnings
- Memory bank documentation is essential for project continuity
- Incremental implementation reduces risk and improves quality
- Early database design decisions have long-term impact
- User experience considerations should drive technical decisions

## Project Insights

### Architecture Decisions
- **Microservices-ready**: API-first design allows for future scaling
- **Containerization**: Docker enables consistent deployment across environments
- **Modern frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript provides excellent developer experience
- **Security-first**: Authentication and authorization built into core architecture

### Risk Mitigation
- **Fallback systems**: Mock data ensures functionality even when services fail
- **Gradual rollout**: Authentication can be added without breaking existing features
- **Comprehensive testing**: Multiple layers of testing ensure reliability
- **Documentation**: Detailed specs and API docs reduce integration friction
