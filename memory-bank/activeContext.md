# Active Context - Recipe AI

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Focus: Authentication Integration ✅ COMPLETED
The project has successfully implemented complete frontend authentication integration with login/register forms, token management, protected routes, and state persistence. Users can now register, login, and access protected features.

### Secondary Focus: Recipe Management Enhancement
Now that authentication is complete, focus shifts to enhancing recipe management with user ownership, CRUD operations, and improved user experience.

## Recent Changes

### Authentication Infrastructure (Last 24-48 hours)
- ✅ Created User model with database operations
- ✅ Implemented JWT authentication middleware
- ✅ Added bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- ✅ Created authentication routes (register, login, refresh)
- ✅ Added role-based access control middleware
- ✅ Updated database schema with users table
- ✅ Integrated authentication into API server

### Frontend Authentication ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created authentication components (LoginForm, RegisterForm)
- ✅ Implemented authentication pages (Login, Register)
- ✅ Set up Zustand auth store for state management
- ✅ Created authentication hooks and utilities
- ✅ Added protected routes with React Router
- ✅ Integrated with API endpoints
- ✅ Implemented token persistence and refresh
- ✅ Added form validation and error handling

### Database Enhancements
- ✅ Added users table with proper constraints
- ✅ Created indexes for performance optimization
- ✅ Implemented foreign key relationships
- ✅ Added database initialization scripts

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 days)
1. **Recipe Management Enhancement**
   - Add user ownership to recipes

   - Add recipe favoriting and personal collections

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add loading states and error boundaries
   - Implement toast notifications for user feedback
   - Enhance responsive design for mobile devices

### Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Recipe Management Enhancement**
   - Add user ownership to recipes
   - Implement recipe CRUD operations for authenticated users
   - Add recipe favoriting and personal collections

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Enhance responsive design for mobile devices
   - Add loading states and error boundaries
   - Implement toast notifications for user feedback

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Add unit tests for authentication components
   - Implement integration tests for auth flow
   - Add form validation with proper error messages

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Architecture
- **JWT Strategy**: Using access tokens + refresh tokens for security
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds for hashing
- **Session Management**: Token-based with configurable expiration
- **Role System**: Simple admin/user roles with middleware enforcement

### Database Design
- **Normalization**: Proper separation of concerns with related tables
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized for search and filtering operations
- **Constraints**: Foreign keys and check constraints for data integrity
- **Performance**: Query optimization for recipe listing and search

### Frontend State Management
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for auth and recipes
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management for API calls
- **React Hook Form**: Form validation and state handling
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout the application

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Feature-based structure**: Group related components, hooks, and utilities
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between API, UI, and business logic
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage with strict typing
- **Error handling**: Consistent error boundaries and user-friendly messages

### API Design
- **RESTful conventions**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **OpenAPI documentation**: Comprehensive API specs with examples
- **Error responses**: Structured error format with meaningful messages
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication with middleware

### Development Workflow
- **Docker development**: Consistent environment across team members
- **Environment configuration**: Separate configs for dev/staging/production
- **Git practices**: Feature branches with clear commit messages
- **Testing strategy**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for flows

## Current Challenges

### Authentication Flow Complexity
- Managing token refresh and expiration
- Handling authentication state across page reloads
- Coordinating between frontend and backend auth state

### Database Mock Fallback
- Current implementation falls back to mock data when DB unavailable
- Need to ensure smooth transition to production database
- Testing both mock and real database scenarios

### Form Validation
- Complex validation requirements for recipe submission
- Real-time validation feedback for better UX
- Handling both client-side and server-side validation

## Learnings and Insights

### Technical Learnings
- JWT token management requires careful handling of expiration
- PostgreSQL connection pooling is crucial for performance
- Docker networking adds complexity to service communication
- TypeScript interfaces improve code maintainability significantly

### Process Learnings
- Memory bank documentation is essential for project continuity
- Incremental implementation reduces risk and improves quality
- Early database design decisions have long-term impact
- User experience considerations should drive technical decisions

## Project Insights

### Architecture Decisions
- **Microservices-ready**: API-first design allows for future scaling
- **Containerization**: Docker enables consistent deployment across environments
- **Modern frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript provides excellent developer experience
- **Security-first**: Authentication and authorization built into core architecture

### Risk Mitigation
- **Fallback systems**: Mock data ensures functionality even when services fail
- **Gradual rollout**: Authentication can be added without breaking existing features
- **Comprehensive testing**: Multiple layers of testing ensure reliability
- **Documentation**: Detailed specs and API docs reduce integration friction
