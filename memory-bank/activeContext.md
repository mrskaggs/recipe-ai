# Active Context - Recipe AI

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Focus: User-Owned Recipe Management ✅ COMPLETED
Successfully implemented complete user-owned recipe system with database schema updates, API endpoints for CRUD operations, and two-step AI recipe creation workflow. Users now have full ownership and control over their recipes.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 days)
1. **Frontend Recipe Management Integration**
   - Update recipe store to handle user-owned recipes and status workflow
   - Create recipe creation form component for authenticated users
   - Create recipe editing form component for recipe owners
   - Update recipe listing pages to show user ownership indicators

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add loading states and error boundaries
   - Implement toast notifications for user feedback
   - Enhance responsive design for mobile devices

### Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Complete Recipe Management System**
   - Add user profile page with user's recipes section
   - Implement recipe favoriting and personal collections
   - Add recipe status indicators (processing, pending review, etc.)
   - Test end-to-end recipe CRUD operations for authenticated users

2. **UI/UX Polish**
   - Enhance responsive design for mobile devices
   - Add loading states and error boundaries
   - Implement toast notifications for user feedback
   - Add recipe status badges and progress indicators

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Add unit tests for recipe management components
   - Implement integration tests for recipe CRUD flow
   - Add form validation with proper error messages

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Architecture
- **JWT Strategy**: Using access tokens + refresh tokens for security
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds for hashing
- **Session Management**: Token-based with configurable expiration
- **Role System**: Simple admin/user roles with middleware enforcement

### Database Design
- **Normalization**: Proper separation of concerns with related tables
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized for search and filtering operations
- **Constraints**: Foreign keys and check constraints for data integrity
- **Performance**: Query optimization for recipe listing and search

### Frontend State Management
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for auth and recipes
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management for API calls
- **React Hook Form**: Form validation and state handling
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout the application

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Feature-based structure**: Group related components, hooks, and utilities
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between API, UI, and business logic
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage with strict typing
- **Error handling**: Consistent error boundaries and user-friendly messages

### API Design
- **RESTful conventions**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **OpenAPI documentation**: Comprehensive API specs with examples
- **Error responses**: Structured error format with meaningful messages
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication with middleware

### Development Workflow
- **Docker development**: Consistent environment across team members
- **Environment configuration**: Separate configs for dev/staging/production
- **Git practices**: Feature branches with clear commit messages
- **Testing strategy**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for flows

## Current Challenges

### Authentication Flow Complexity
- Managing token refresh and expiration
- Handling authentication state across page reloads
- Coordinating between frontend and backend auth state

### Database Mock Fallback
- Current implementation falls back to mock data when DB unavailable
- Need to ensure smooth transition to production database
- Testing both mock and real database scenarios

### Form Validation
- Complex validation requirements for recipe submission
- Real-time validation feedback for better UX
- Handling both client-side and server-side validation

## Learnings and Insights

### Technical Learnings
- JWT token management requires careful handling of expiration
- PostgreSQL connection pooling is crucial for performance
- Docker networking adds complexity to service communication
- TypeScript interfaces improve code maintainability significantly

### Process Learnings
- Memory bank documentation is essential for project continuity
- Incremental implementation reduces risk and improves quality
- Early database design decisions have long-term impact
- User experience considerations should drive technical decisions

## Project Insights

### Architecture Decisions
- **Microservices-ready**: API-first design allows for future scaling
- **Containerization**: Docker enables consistent deployment across environments
- **Modern frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript provides excellent developer experience
- **Security-first**: Authentication and authorization built into core architecture

### Risk Mitigation
- **Fallback systems**: Mock data ensures functionality even when services fail
- **Gradual rollout**: Authentication can be added without breaking existing features
- **Comprehensive testing**: Multiple layers of testing ensure reliability
- **Documentation**: Detailed specs and API docs reduce integration friction
